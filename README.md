# JJ-Serverless-Portfolio 
This is an AWS/Serverless self tutorial using a simple HTML/JavaScript webpage as a usecase to build a personal online Portfolio    
  
    
At the end of the Course, I would have successfully deployed my sourcecode from a github or gitlab repository to an AWS S3 Bucket, that in turn would demonstrate my tangible understanding of the following technology under Amazon Web Services :-   


* AWS Lambda
* AWS S3
* AWS CloudFront
* AWS IAM
* AWS Route 53
* AWS SNS
* AWS CodeBuild
* AWS CodePipeline
  
  and these modern technologies:  
  
* ReactJS Framework/Library
* Git and Github
* Node Package Manager (NPM)
* Webpack module bundler
* Babel
* Jest
  
## Technology used (so far)  
  
* Atom Editor

* Git and github  
* SSH  
* HTML  
* CSS

* Google Fonts  
  
## AWS Services (so far)
